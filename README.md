# inherited_widget_sample

A sample Flutter application about Inherited Widget.

## Versions

This sample consists of following three samples of implementation.

* Standard inherited widget version (completely self-implemented version that notifies value's change to child widget)
* Provider version (replaces with my own InheritedWidget implementation by provider)
* Value notifier version (improve the provider version to make it easier)
