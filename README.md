# inherited_widget_sample

A sample Flutter application about Inherited Widget.

## Versions

This sample consists of following three samples of implementation.

* standard inherited widget version (completely self-implemented version that notifies value's change to child widget)
* provider version (replaces with my own InheritedWidget implementation by provider)
* value notifier version (modify to provider version)
